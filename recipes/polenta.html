        <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese and butter.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or spray it liberally with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot polenta onto the baking sheet and spread it to the edges of the baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Chill the sheet until the polenta is cold and firm, about 60-90 minutes. </li>
        <li>Once chilled, cut the polenta into the desired size and shape. </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the polenta to the pan and fry it until it's golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side. If the polenta is sticking to the pan, it's not ready to flip yet.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, serve fried polenta with the dipping sauce of your choice. </li>
    </ol>
