    <h3 class="header">Description</h3>

    <p>Pamonha is a boiled paste made from sweet corn whisked in coconut milk, typically served wrapped in corn husks..</p>
    
    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sweet corn cobs, around 400g sweet corn kernels</li>
        <li>150 g sugar</li>
        <li>75 ml milk, approximately</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a sharp knife cut off the end of the cob, shuck the corn and clean off the silk threads. Set aside the most beautiful husks to “wrap” the “pamonha”.</li>
        <li>Remove kernels from the corn cob with a knife and blend kernels with the milk to a paste. In the traditional recipe kernels are grated off the cob and the pulp is passed through a sieve (large aperture).</li>
        <li>Pour the corn pulp in a bowl and add the sugar, the melted butter and the salt. Mix well. The mixture should be thick. If necessary add a little more milk.</li>
        <li>Wash the corn husks and blanch them in boiling water for a few seconds to make them more malleable.</li>
        <li>“wrap” the “pamonhas” with the corn husks, tie the “packet” with a string or with a small strip of corn husk.</li>
    </ol>
